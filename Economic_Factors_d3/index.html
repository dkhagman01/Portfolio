          <h2>Correlations Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Based on data collected by the U.S. 2014 Census Data Survey we can create visualizations to analyze a 
            number of relationships between poverty, age, household income, obesity, smoking, and health insurance 
            coverage, at the state level.</p>

          <p>Beginning with the percentages of individuals living in poverty, there exists a positive association 
            between a lack of healthcare coverage and poverty rate, particularly in many southern states and New 
            Mexico. In many of these same states, the relationship between obesity and smoking rates and the relative 
            number of individuals living in poverty are much stronger.</p>

          <p>These same trends are apparent with median household income. Essentially, those states with lower median 
            incomes tend to have higher levels of individuals lacking health insurance, and higher rates of smoking and 
            obesity. Texas is the big standout here, in that it has an unusually high number of uninsured relative to its 
            income, which as we saw above is tied in part to poverty.</p>

          <p>The age range spanning 30-44 years among those participating in this census does not appear to exhibit any 
            relationships between age and obesity, smoking, or health insurance coverage.</p>
