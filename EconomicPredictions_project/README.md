    	A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    	A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    	A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3.	Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4.	Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5.	Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6.	Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
7.  Your project must include a machine learning component.
